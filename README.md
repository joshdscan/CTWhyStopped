# Transforming Clinical Trial Why Stopped Labeling

## Overview

This project automates the labeling of unstructured clinical trial text data to identify reasons for trial termination using machine learning.

## Objectives

- **Data Transformation**: Convert unstructured text data from ClinicalTrials.gov for ML applications.
- **Model Development**: Implement BERT and logistic regression models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compare models using precision, recall and F1 scores.

## Data Source

Data is sourced from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/opentargets/clinical_trial_reason_to_stop), OpenTargets provided a clean and ready to use manually curated dataset.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare text data.
2. **Model Implementation**: Use BERT and logistic regression models.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: Train models and evaluate performance.
4. **Comparison**: Analyze strengths and weaknesses of each model.
