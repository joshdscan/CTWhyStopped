# Transforming Clinical Trial Labeling

Welcome to my project for MGTA611 in Winter 2024. My goal was to automate the process of assigning structured labels to unstructured clinical trial text data. Leveraging a transformer model, specifically a pre-trained BERT, and comparing it with a simple logistic regression model, I aimed to understand the reasons clinical trials end.

## Key Highlights

- **Automated Labeling:** I used a BERT model to classify trial endings, aiming to make manual curation less burdensome.
- **Model Comparison:** Included a logistic regression model for benchmarking, highlighting the transformer model's advantages.
- **Dataset:** Utilized data from ClinicalTrials.gov, focusing on transforming it for machine learning applications.
- **Evaluation:** Concentrated on precision, recall, and F1 scores to assess the model's performance.

## Installation and Usage

Setup instructions and dependency requirements are outlined under "Installing Required Dependencies". For details on dataset preparation and model training, refer to "Dataset Collection and Formatting" and "Model Training".

## Conclusion

This project showed the potential of using machine learning to streamline clinical trial data analysis. It's a step towards reducing manual effort and improving data curation efficiency.
